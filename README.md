# Derivatives Pricing and Risk Management Engine

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive, robust engine designed for pricing various derivative instruments and analyzing associated risk exposures. It demonstrates expertise in handling sophisticated quantitative models, simulating market scenarios, and effectively managing derivative portfolios.

## Features and Functionalities

### 1. Option Pricing Models

- **European, American, and Exotic Options**: Pricing implemented via multiple methodologies:
  - **Analytical Models**: Black-Scholes Model.
  - **Numerical Methods**: Binomial Trees.
  - **Simulation Techniques**: Monte Carlo Simulations.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Evaluates how option prices vary with changes in volatility, underlying price, interest rates, and other market parameters.

### 2. Model Calibration

- **Market Data Calibration**: Accurately calibrates quantitative models to real-world market data.
- **Error Minimization**: Implements optimization routines to reduce discrepancies between market-observed prices and model-generated prices, improving the reliability of valuation.

### 3. Risk Metrics Calculation

- **Greeks Computation**: Calculates critical risk metrics including Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Theta.
- **Portfolio Risk Aggregation**: Aggregates and visualizes risk metrics at the portfolio level, enabling efficient scenario and stress-testing capabilities.

### 4. Portfolio Management

- **Performance Tracking**: Manages and tracks performance metrics of derivative portfolios over time.
- **Simulation Environment**: Provides comprehensive simulations under varied market conditions to evaluate and manage portfolio risk exposures effectively.

### 5. Reporting & Visualization

- **Dynamic Reports**: Automatically generates detailed reports summarizing pricing accuracy, risk exposures, and model calibration performance.
- **Visual Analytics**: Offers intuitive visualizations for quick interpretation and strategic decision-making.
